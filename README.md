### What is a Sequence?

A **Sequence** is a comprehensive record of all your actions and interactions in your digital life, such as sending messages, receiving emails, and navigating through apps. These actions and interactions are organized into a coherent structure that helps you manage your digital interactions more effectively.

### The Role of the Assistant

Through the power of AI, the Assistant leverages your Sequences to understand what has happened in your digital life. It can answer your questions based on your current context, help manage your Sequences, and even generate a personalized AI tailored to your unique behavior patterns. This personalized AI not only enhances your productivity but also ensures that your digital interactions are as seamless and efficient as possible.
