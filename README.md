## Overview

**LinQ** is a Linked Sequence platform designed to bring all your digital activities together in one place. By connecting everything you do online into a single, easy-to-follow POD (Personal Online Data), LinQ helps you stay organized and in control. With the power of AI, LinQ acts as your personal assistant, learning from your habits to offer helpful suggestions and make your digital life smoother and more efficient. üîíü§ñ

### What is a Sequence?

A **Sequence** is a comprehensive record of all your actions and interactions in your digital life, such as sending messages, receiving emails, and navigating through apps. These actions and interactions are organized into a coherent structure that helps you manage your digital interactions more effectively.

### The Role of the Assistant

Harnessing the power of AI, the Assistant leverages your Sequences to understand what has happened in your digital life. By interacting with or observing the user, the Assistant quietly learns to assist within the framework of the user's [DIKW pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_pyramid), and in turn, aids in collecting data, organizing information, distilling knowledge, and expressing wisdom. The result is a personalized AI that adapts to your unique behavior patterns, enhancing your productivity and ensuring seamless and efficient digital interactions.

## Features

### Privacy-First Semantic Sequence
